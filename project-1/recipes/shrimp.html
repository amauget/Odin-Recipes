        <p>This pan-fried shrimp is tossed with an easy Italian seasoning and then saut√©ed in butter and lemon. Though we often enjoy breaded shrimp such as our bang bang shrimp recipe, 
            this pan sauteed shrimp is completely ready in 10 minutes, perfect for quick dinners!</p>
        <h2>Sauteed Shrimp Seasoning</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Italian seasoning:</strong> a blend of herbs used to flavor many Italian dishes.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and pepper:</strong> classic seasoning for any dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Paprika:</strong> It adds a hint of smoky mild sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>One whole lemon</strong>: to squeeze onto the shrimp after cooking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Saute Shrimp</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Devein and remove the tail of shrimp (I kept my tail on b/c they look better in pictures).</li>
            <li>In a <strong>bowl</strong>, combine the ingredients for the seasonings. Whisk together the Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and paprika.</li>
            <li>Then in a <strong>skillet</strong>, add the butter and garlic, saute until the garlic is fragrant (30 seconds to 1 minute), stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Add seasoned shrimp and cook 2-3 minutes per side over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and drizzle freshly squeezed lemon over the entire dish.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
