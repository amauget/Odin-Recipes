            <li>2 pounds skinless boneless chicken breasts <em>medium-size breasts</em>4 </li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic salt <em>use 2 teaspoons if you have 2 pounds of chicken breasts</em></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Herbes de Provence <em>or Italian seasoning</em></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the mustard cream sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallot <em>1 medium, about ½ of a medium size shallot</em></li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic <em>finely minced</em></li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 medium bay leaf</li>
            <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon grainy Dijon mustard <em>I like Maille</em></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons corn starch</li>
            <li>fresh dill <em>or use thyme or rosemary (or a combination), for garnish</em></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>For the chicken:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the garlic salt, Herbs de Provence, flour, sugar and pepper in a small bowl and stir to combine. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Cut the chicken breasts in half horizontally. To do this, lay the breasts out on a work surface, then place your nondominant hand on the top and slice horizontally halfway through the meat (to create two thin cutlets) with your dominant hand. Lay the chicken breasts out in a single layer on the work surface and sprinkle on both sides with the garlic salt mixture.</li>
            <li>In a large cast iron, heavy-duty skillet or shallow braiser, melt the butter with the olive oil over medium heat until starting to sizzle a bit,</li>
            <li>Add the chicken breasts, smooth sides down and cook for 4-6 minutes or until the underside is golden (if the breasts are thicker go for 5-6 minutes if thin, 4-5 is good). Flip the breasts to the opposite side and cook for another 1 minute. (The chicken will not be completely cooked at this time but will finish cooking later.) Transfer to a clean plate and cover loosely with foil.</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>For the mustard cream sauce:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the chopped shallots to the pan and sauté over medium-low heat for 1-2 minutes until softened and fragrant. Add the garlic and sauté for another 30 seconds. Add the wine and increase the heat to medium-high, stirring frequently and scraping any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook at a rapid boil or until most of the wine has evaporated.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and bay leaves and bring the mixture to a steady low boil. Cook, uncovered for 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the broth is cooking, combine the cream, mustard and cornstarch and stir vigorously with a fork until nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>This step is totally optional, but if you like a really smooth sauce, you can strain it through a fine mesh strainer at this point, pushing on the solids until all the liquid is removed. Discard the solids, return the sauce to the pan and bring it to a boil then proceed as directed.</li>
            <li>Add the cream mixture to the simmering sauce and any juice that has accumulated on the plate with the chicken. Stir until well combined. Bring back to a boil then reduce to a slow simmer over low heat. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove the bay leaves and discard them. Taste and add additional salt and pepper, if needed.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken back to the pan, cover the pan tightly and turn off the heat. Allow the chicken to sit, undisturbed for 5 minutes. Serve the chicken, drizzled with the sauce and pass extra at the table. Garnish with fresh dill sprigs, thyme leaves or finely chopped rosemary. Enjoy!</li>
